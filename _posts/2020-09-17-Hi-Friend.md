Greetings. I will be using this blog to share my journey and progress through the world of cyber security.

I'm a Computer Science MsC currently working full-time as a Software Developer and studying Ethical Hacking/Penetration Testing and Reverse Engineering during my free time.

Due to my academic background I already have some knowledge on a select bunch of tech subjects, but I will be nonetheless taking a "zero to hero" approach to hacking. I will try to routinely share every resource that I use to climb my way through this exciting field. My plan is to study, learn and practice as much as I can in order to get certified (OSCP for starters) and eventually make a career of it.

As of the time of this post I am midway through Heath Adams' (@thecybermentor) [Udemy course Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/) and I'm really enjoying it so far!

I hope this blog succeeds in giving a helping hand to anyone interested in learning and getting started in this field just like me. Suggestions, tips and corrections are welcome.
Lastly I'd like to thank everyone in the community who spreads their knowledge and allows us to learn along.

See you!
