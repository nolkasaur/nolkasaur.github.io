Greetings! I will be using this blog to share my journey and progress through the world of hacking (among other stuff!).

I'm currently working full-time as a software developer and on my free time I like to study and learn more about the cyber security field, reverse engineering, tinker with 3D modeling and most recently the Rust programming language.

I have an academic background (Computer Science MSc) so I already have some general knowledge about multiple tech fields, but I will be nonetheless taking a "zero to hero" approach to hacking. I will try to routinely share the resources I find and use to climb my way through this broad and exciting field. My short term objective is to become knowledgeable up until the point I feel I can (and will) successfully pass the OSCP exam. In the long term I'm interested in a career in the field.

As of the time of this post I am midway through Heath Adams' ([@thecybermentor](https://twitter.com/thecybermentor)) [Udemy course Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/) and it's fantastic so far.

I hope this blog succeeds in motivating and getting other people interested in the field. Suggestions, tips and corrections are welcome!

I would like to thank everyone in the community who shares their time and knowledge with others.

See you!
