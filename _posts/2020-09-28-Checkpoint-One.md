Today I completed Heath Adams' ([@thecybermentor](https://twitter.com/thecybermentor)) [Udemy course Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/).
It's a great beginner reference, it covers a broad selection of topics and Heath is just awesome. Among some refreshers on networking and scripting with bash and python I was able to learn a bit more about network penetration testing (including Active Directory), webapp penetration testing and other useful advice, technical and career wise. I feel a bit more prepared to get hands on from here on. I definitely plan on revisiting this course a few more times in the future when I get a HackTheBox subscription and start working on rooting machines.

The next step for me is to complete both of Heath's other courses, [Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-privilege-escalation-for-beginners/) and [Windows Privilege Escalation for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation-for-beginners/). 

See you then!
