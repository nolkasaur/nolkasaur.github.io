I"q<p>Today I completed Heath Adams’ (<a href="https://twitter.com/thecybermentor">@thecybermentor</a>) <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/">Udemy course Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course</a>.
Took me a while longer than scheduled to do so as these past two weeks have been a little mental and I haven’t gotten as much free time to work on it as I desired. I plan on being more consistent starting now.
I think it’s a great course for beginners, it touches on a broad selection of topics and the instructor is awesome. Among some refreshers on networking and scripting with bash and python I was able to learn a bit about network penetration testing (including Active Directory), webapp penetration testing and some other useful topics and advice, technical and career wise. I feel a bit more prepared to get hands on. I definitely plan on revisiting this course a few more times in the future when I get a HackTheBox subscription and start digging machines.</p>

<p>The plan for the next 2 weeks is to go through and complete both of Heath’s other courses, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-privilege-escalation-for-beginners/">Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation-for-beginners/">Windows Privilege Escalation for Beginners</a>.</p>

<p>See you then!</p>
